## Summary

I am a data scientist with 2 years of experience in data analysis, manipulation and visualization using Python,SQL and Excel. I have worked with data in different formats. I love to tell interesting stories by extracting meaningful insight from data.

## Projects

### Python

- **[Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species](https://github.com/nzubeifechukwu/clustering-antarctic-penguin-species/blob/main/clustering-antarctic-penguins.ipynb)**: I perform a cluster analysis of penguins in Antarctic to identify groups in the data.
- **[Predictive Modeling for Agriculture](https://github.com/nzubeifechukwu/predictive-modeling-agric/blob/main/predictive_modeling_agric.ipynb)**: I use my machine learning knowledge to help a farmer select the best crops for their fields.
- **[Hypothesis Testing with Men's and Women's Soccer Matches](https://github.com/nzubeifechukwu/hypothesis-testing-men-women-soccer/blob/main/hypothesis_testing_soccer.ipynb)**: I perform a hypothesis test to determine if more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches than men's.
- **[Customer Analyticsâ€”Preparing Data for Modeling](https://github.com/nzubeifechukwu/customer-analytics)**: I apply my knowledge of data types and categorical data to prepare, transform and efficiently store a dataset of trainees at a hypothetical data science training provider for data modeling.

### SQL

- **[Analyzing Sales by a Pet Product Retailer](https://github.com/nzubeifechukwu/pet-supplies/blob/main/pet_supplies.ipynb)**: I clean sales data for a pet product retailer and analyze how repeat purchases of some products impact sales.
- **[Analyzing Students' Mental Health](https://github.com/nzubeifechukwu/students-mental-health/blob/main/students_mental_health.ipynb)**: I analyze a dataset of students in a Japanese university to understand how the length of stay impacts their average mental health.
